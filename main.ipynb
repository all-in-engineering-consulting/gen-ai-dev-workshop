The military, particularly the Navy, sought a method to capture and electronically store all technical documentation related to their high-value equipment. This led to the creation of a military specification (MIL-SPEC) for Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals. Initially, producing these manuals was quite expensive, but advancements in technology over the years have made it more feasible to store and manage technical information electronically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since their inception, ITMs have evolved significantly. They now incorporate various features such as clickable tabs for easy navigation, integration with real-time data through URLs, and the ability to house multimedia content like videos, schematics, and 3D drawings. This evolution has enhanced their functionality, allowing users to quickly access comprehensive technical information and troubleshoot complex systems effectively, thereby minimizing downtime.\n",
