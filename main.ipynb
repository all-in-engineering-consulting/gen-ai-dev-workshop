      "multimodal_rag_agent: The ITM's schematic interface enhances the understanding of complex hydraulic systems through several key features. Firstly, the use of colored and animated schematics allows users to visualize the flow of fluids through the hydraulic circuit, making it easier to comprehend how different components interact in real-time. The incorporation of 3D representations of components further aids in understanding by providing a more intuitive view of the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the interface includes \"hotspots\" on major components, which users can click to access detailed component sheets. These sheets provide essential information such as part numbers, descriptions, functions, and safety information, which are crucial for technicians and engineers to troubleshoot and understand complex components effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the ability to separate schematics based on operating status allows users to see the system in various states, illustrating how valves shift and pressure changes occur. This dynamic representation helps users interpret the functionality of the hydraulic system more clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the combination of animated visuals, interactive hotspots, and detailed component information makes the ITM's schematic interface a powerful tool for enhancing the understanding of complex hydraulic systems. \n",
