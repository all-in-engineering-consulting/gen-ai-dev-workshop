We've abbreviated that, and we call our software product an Interactive Technical Manual, even shorter, an ITM. So ITMs were created from military specifications in the late 80s, shortly after PCs or personal computers became mainstream. Shortly thereafter, they were used in business and industry, and the military, specifically the Navy, wanted a way to capture all the technical documentation. They wanted a way to capture all the technical documentation on all of their high -value equipment and electronically store that. So they created a MIL -SPEC, or a military specification, on Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals. They were very expensive to produce back in the late 80s, and over the years, technology has advanced to the point where we can technologically store all the technical information that we need.",

We enhance those schematics. There's color standards for hydraulic and pneumatic drawings and we'll add color to that particular drawing so that it's intuitive to your technicians and engineers and you can exactly what line should be pressure, what flow should be metered, what pressure should be reduced. Color augments the schematic documentation and makes the experience of reading and understanding fluid power and electrical circuits far more intuitive when they're colored. It really helps the technicians and engineers understand the 4D systems well which One of the other things we can do with schematics is we can separate them out for a particular operating status.

For example, this is a variable displacement pressure compensated hydraulic pump.

So with the photo navigation, we have a digital photograph of the test stand, and then there's those hotspots again. So you can click on these hotspots directly from a digital photograph and bring up that same component sheet that describes how that particular component works. So this happened to be a relief valve. So click on that and bring up the component photo. If you wanted information on that, we tie the cut sheet. This happened to be a sun relief valve. And then even though I got to the component sheet through digital photography, now I can click on the schematic and then that component's highlighted so that I can find that component on the schematic itself. So if I'm trying to troubleshoot, I could turn the hotspots off and then put the system in a particular operating condition. And look at where pressure's supposed to be.
