Here's a transcript of the video:

```text

```

I need you to break it down into meaningful parts and name each.

Output the result in a valid json format with the following structure:

```json

[

{"name": "[part 1 name]", "start": "[first 7 words of the part]", "finish": "[last 7 words of the part]"(parts can intersect for not more than 20%) }

]

```
